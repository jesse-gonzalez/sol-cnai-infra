  To deploy workstation cli tools, easiest method is to leverage nix/devbox shell.
  To do so, run the following commands:
  ------
    make install-linux-dependencies
    task workstation:bootstrap-jumpbox --yes
    source ~/.bashrc
    devbox shell

  - Run `eval $(task switch-shell-env)` to switch between environments.
  - If K8s cluster already exists, for example NKP, run `task nkp:get-cluster-kubeconfig --force`
  To see list of tasks, run `task --list` or `task --list-all`
